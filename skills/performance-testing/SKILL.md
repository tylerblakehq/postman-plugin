name: performance-testing
description: Load-tests a collection with concurrent virtual users, a chosen load profile, and pass/fail thresholds on latency or error rate — run locally or on Postman's cloud runners. Use when the user asks to "load test this API," "run a performance test," "check how this holds up under load," or "benchmark this collection." Covers `postman performance run`. Not for page-load or Core Web Vitals (LCP, INP, CLS, Lighthouse, PageSpeed) — that is the `website-performance` skill. This generates real traffic against a real target — confirm the target and scale before running, the same way any action with effects outside this session gets confirmed.

# Performance Testing

## Overview

`performance run <collectionId>` is not `collection run` with more
iterations — it's a dedicated load-test mode: many virtual users hitting the
collection concurrently for a set duration, shaped by a load profile, scored
against thresholds you define, on infrastructure you choose. The collection
under test is authored the normal way — see the `collection-schema-v3` skill
if it needs edits before the load test is meaningful (e.g. an assertion
that would fail every VU's request identically).

Page paint, Lighthouse scores, and layout shift are not this skill — see
`website-performance` for Core Web Vitals and page-load work.

## Core knowledge

- **Load profile is what you're actually testing.** `fixed` holds steady
  concurrency (does this hold up at N users, sustained); `ramp-up` increases
  gradually (where does it start to degrade); `spike` bursts suddenly (does
  a sudden surge break it); `peak` sustains near-maximum load (does it
  survive staying there). Pick based on the failure mode being probed, not
  by default.
- **`--runner` chooses where load originates.** `local` runs from the
  current machine/CI runner — bounded by its own resources, fine for
  internal or low-scale targets. `postman-cloud` runs from Postman's
  infrastructure — needed for realistic external-scale load, or once local
  resources would cap the achievable VU count. `postman-cloud-static-ip`
  is the same, from a static-IP range — needed when the target allowlists
  by IP.
- **`--pass-if "less_than(p95, 500)"` turns a load test into a gate.**
  Metrics: `avg`, `p90`, `p95`, `p99`, `error_rate`, `rps`. Checked after the
  run completes, not enforced live — a bad configuration still generates its
  full load before the gate fails.
- **`--use-mock` points the test at a mock instead of a real backend** — for
  load-testing collection/script logic itself, or to baseline mock-only
  latency and isolate app/network slowness from what the mock adds.
- **`--setup-collection`/`--teardown-collection`** (cloud runner only) run
  once before/after the whole test — for provisioning or cleanup, not
  per-iteration setup.
- **`--dataset-id`/`--dataset-view-id`** drive iteration data from a Postman
  Dataset instead of a flat `--data-file`; `--dataset-distribution` controls
  whether rows are spread round-robin, fixed, or randomly across VUs.

## Critical Rules

1. **Running this against a real, non-mock backend generates real load with
   real consequences — confirm the target, VU count, and duration with the
   user before running,** the same way any action with effects outside this
   session gets confirmed. Default to a low `--vu-count` and short
   `--duration` for a first run against anything live, or point it at a mock
   (`--use-mock`) when the goal is testing the collection, not the backend.
2. **A `--pass-if` gate doesn't stop the load early.** The full VU count and
   duration run regardless of whether the threshold will ultimately pass —
   plan for that cost, don't assume a failing gate means less traffic was
   sent.
3. **Cloud runners come from Postman's IP ranges.** Before assuming a
   `postman-cloud` run will reach a target, check whether it's IP-allowlisted
   — use `postman-cloud-static-ip` if so, rather than discovering the
   mismatch as a wall of connection failures.
4. **Do not use this skill for website page-load work.** LCP, INP, CLS,
   Lighthouse, PageSpeed, images, and fonts belong in `website-performance`.

## Verification

State the actual metrics the run produced (p95, error rate, rps — whatever
the `--pass-if` checked, plus the ones it didn't) and whether the gate
passed, not just that the run completed. State which runner actually
executed it (`local`/`postman-cloud`/`postman-cloud-static-ip`) — that
determines whether the numbers reflect the target's real-world reachability
or only local-network conditions.
